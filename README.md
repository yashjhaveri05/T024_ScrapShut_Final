# NGO Website

This Website was made for a Hackathon.We have made this webiste in 24 hours.

## Tech Stack Used
1. Django 
2. Django Rest Framework
3. HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Bootstrap

## Problem Statement
The current pandemic has caused an acute shortage of medicines, ventilators, beds and other medical equipment throughout the nation. There are NGOs trying to procure these essentials for the poor and middle class who do not have the means to purchase these things.Create a website to server this purpose where NGOs can add their requirements and the donors can donate to them.<br />

## About
We at NGOWebsite provide a platform where any NGO can signup and create the requirements for the equipments required to serve tthe people in remote areas and the needy people to fight the Corona Virus. Other users visiting the website can view these requirements and choose to donate to them that specific equipment hence helping the NGOs and inturn the society!For each donation accepted and successfully made,the user gets credit points in his account with which he can redeem items from a list of products available on our site!!We try our best to authenticate the NGO so that there is no fraud and only the NGO to which the person has donated has the sole discretion to validate the donations made by the user!! Only upon validating,will the user be credited with the credit points!!<br />

## Key Features
1. SignUp based upon type of user: NGO or Donor<br />
2. Login<br />
3. Authentication by website admin to check whether the NGO is credible using its signup data<br />
4. CRUD functionality for the requirements which can solely be done by the NGOs<br />
5. Donor can select a particular requirement made by the NGOs and donate to it<br />
6. NGO can authenticate whether the donation is received or not upon which that particular donor gets credit points<br />
7. List of all redeemable items<br />
8. User can redeem any item based upon his/her credit points<br />
9. NGO Dashboard to keep track of all its listed items and all the donations received<br />
10. Donor Dashboard to keep track of all the donations made and the items redeemed<br />
11. APIs to display the the list of donors and ngos along with list of requirements and donations made<br />
12. Multi Language Functionality also available

## Future Prospects
1. Although, only COVID situations are considered while designing this platform, donation of other forms too can be incorporated by integrating the website with the payment portal.
2. O-Auth can also be incorporated into the authentication mechanism so as to prevent the donors from the hassle of registration yet, NGO signup would always be through the original registration as it involves collection of certificate (which confirms the authenticity of an entity as NGO) issued by the authorities.
3. The facility of chat bot would thereby contribute in increased efficiency of communication and speedy grievance redressal for NGOs and various donors.
4. Partnership with other merchandise based companies in order to increase the redeemable item base. This would further increase the incentive for the donors to use this platform.
